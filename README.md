A powerful, user-friendly Home Assistant integration and local load controller for CitrineOS. It bridges Home Assistant's local sensing (grid meter, solar inverter, home battery) with CitrineOS's OCPP smart charging layer to provide automated solar surplus tracking, main fuse protection, priority EV power allocation, and CSIP-Aus dynamic operating envelopes.

- Domain: `citrine_ha`
- Path: `custom_components/citrine_ha`
- Supports UI Config Flow & full Options Flow
- Multi-mode real-time closed loop energy governor (1-2s cycle)
- Automated solar surplus & battery discharge allocation
- Dynamic multi-station priority weighting and minimum pilot current ($6\text{ A}$) protection
- Dual device architecture: **Citrine Energy Controller Hub** & **Per-Station Charger Controls**

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Local Load Controller
* **Real-time Closed Loop:** Continuously evaluates grid import/export, solar generation, and home battery power every 1–3 seconds.
* **Main Fuse Protection:** Enforces hard site import limits with instantaneous asymmetric curtailment if household loads spike.
* **Anti-Chatter & Dwell Protection:** Enforces a $6\text{ A}$ minimum pilot floor ($1.38\text{ kW}$ 1-ph / $4.14\text{ kW}$ 3-ph) and minimum 30-second dwell time to protect EV contactors against intermittent cloud cover or appliance cycling.
* **Deadband Slew Limiting:** Power changes smaller than the deadband (default $250\text{ W}$) are filtered out to prevent unnecessary network overhead and relay wear.

### 2. Intelligent Operating Modes
Selectable on the fly via `select.citrine_controller_mode`:
* **Solar Only:** Charges strictly from excess solar generation above a configurable start buffer.
* **Solar + Battery:** Uses excess solar and allows drawing from the home battery down to a minimum configurable SOC.
* **Grid Capped (Fast):** Maximizes EV charging speed while ensuring total site load stays safely below the main grid fuse rating.
* **Dynamic Envelope (DOE):** Follows dynamic utility operating envelopes (CSIP-Aus / IEEE 2030.5).
* **Off / Emergency Safe:** Suspends all charging or drops power to safe minimums immediately.

### 3. Multi-Station Power Allocator
* Dynamically balances available site power across multiple connected EVSEs.
* Supports **Per-Station Priority (1 to 5)**: higher-priority vehicles receive power first.
* Supports **Per-Station Mode Overrides**: `auto` (follows site controller), `boost` (max power override), and `pause` (temporarily suspend).

3. Control services
- `citrine_ha.start_charging`
- `citrine_ha.stop_charging`
- `citrine_ha.set_station_limit`
- `citrine_ha.set_group_limit`
- `citrine_ha.set_charging_profile`
- `citrine_ha.clear_charging_profile`

- `citrine_ha.clear_ems_telemetry_error`

Bidirectional note:
- `set_charging_profile` supports negative `limit` values for stations that advertise bidirectional profile support in the integration capability cache (typically OCPP 2.x).
- Stations mapped as non-bidirectional (for example OCPP 1.6 by default) will reject negative profile limits with a clear error.
- Set `duration` to `0` for an indefinite profile (the integration omits duration in the OCPP schedule payload).
- Charging profile controls and service calls support explicit `profile_kind` selection. OCPP 2.0.1 exposes `Absolute` and `Relative`; OCPP 2.1 additionally exposes `Dynamic`.
- OCPP 2.1 stations additionally support `Dynamic` profile kind and can push both `limit` and `setpoint` values.
- `set_charging_profile` accepts optional `setpoint` and `profile_periods` for advanced multi-period dynamic schedules.
- OCPP 2.1 dynamic profiles support optional `operation_mode` and `discharge_limit` controls.
- Supported OCPP 2.1 operation modes in HA are: `ChargingOnly`, `ExternalLimits`, `CentralSetpoint`, `ExternalSetpoint`, `LocalFrequency`, `LocalLoadBalancing`, and `Idle`.
- Operation-mode controls are capability-gated: non-2.1 stations do not expose the `Profile Operation Mode` select in HA.
- Service input normalization matches UI capability rules: if `set_charging_profile` is called with an unsupported `operation_mode`, the integration automatically falls back to the station default mode.
- Changing `Profile Limit`, `Profile Setpoint`, or `Profile Discharge Limit` immediately pushes an updated profile.
- If a charger applies the profile but drives power in the opposite sign direction, set `Profile Sign Mode` to `invert_negative` for that station.
- `Profile Tx Mode` controls TxProfile behavior: use `safe_fallback` for charger compatibility fallbacks, or `strict_txprofile` to keep `TxProfile` unchanged.

4. Protocol-aware API calls
- OCPP 2.0.1 and OCPP 1.6 start/stop mappings
- OCPP 2.0.1 and OCPP 1.6 smart charging profile mappings for limits
- OCPP protocol normalization for mixed station metadata formats (for example `ocpp16`, `1.6`, `OCPP 2.0`)
- Endpoint fallback workarounds for deployments exposing `/ocpp/2.0/*` instead of `/ocpp/2.0.1/*`
- Retry workarounds for common profile issues (connector `0` rejection on OCPP 1.6, unit compatibility fallback)
- OCPP 2.0.1 `remoteStartId` can be sourced from transactions and incremented per station
- Per-station protocol and capability cache guides entity options and command payload selection
- EMS profile-control entities are now guarded by the same CSMS-facing support rules used by the EMS policy slice
- If a charger is ineligible for EMS profile control, the `EMS Profile Eligibility` diagnostic sensor exposes the exact support reason and the profile-control entities are unavailable in HA
- EMS telemetry consumption via Citrine Data API endpoint `GET /data/<ems-endpoint-prefix>/emsIntakeTelemetry`
- Options now support `ems_endpoint_prefix`, `ems_telemetry_site_id`, and `ems_telemetry_limit` for telemetry scoping
- Options now support `ems_telemetry_stale_secs` for telemetry stale detection threshold
- `sync_ems_telemetry_now` also supports optional per-call overrides for `site_id` and `telemetry_limit`
- EMS intake total attributes now include `fetched_at` and `last_success_at` timestamps

EMS profile eligibility rules:
- `eligible` means the integration believes the charger can participate in Citrine EMS charging-profile control.
- `ineligible` means one of the current conservative guards blocked the charger, for example:
- protocol is not `ocpp2.0.1` or `ocpp2.1`
- station advertised capabilities exist but do not include `ChargingProfileCapable`
- the integration could not derive a compatible EMS profile-control path

The `EMS Profile Eligibility` sensor attributes include:
- `ems_profile_support_reason`
- `advertised_capabilities`
- `normalized_protocol`
- `supports_dynamic_profiles`
- `supports_set_charging_profile`

Example Lovelace card:

```yaml
type: entities
title: Citrine EMS Profile Eligibility
entities:
  - entity: sensor.station_a_ems_profile_eligibility
    name: Station A EMS Profile Eligibility
  - entity: sensor.station_b_ems_profile_eligibility
    name: Station B EMS Profile Eligibility
```

If you want to expose the support reason inline, use an attribute row card or template entity. For example with Mushroom template cards:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: entities
    title: Citrine EMS Profile Eligibility
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.station_a_ems_profile_eligibility
      - entity: sensor.station_b_ems_profile_eligibility
  - type: markdown
    content: >
      **Station A reason:**
      {{ state_attr('sensor.station_a_ems_profile_eligibility', 'ems_profile_support_reason') or 'Eligible' }}

      **Station B reason:**
      {{ state_attr('sensor.station_b_ems_profile_eligibility', 'ems_profile_support_reason') or 'Eligible' }}
```

Entity naming note:
- Replace `station_a` / `station_b` with your actual Home Assistant entity ids.
- The integration unique id suffix for this sensor is `_ems_profile_eligibility`.

## Hasura query for stations, connectors, and transactions

Use this as the discovery query value in the config flow/options:

```graphql
query ChargingStations($tenantId: Int!) {
  ChargingStations(where: {tenantId: {_eq: $tenantId}}) {
    id
    protocol
    isOnline
    chargePointVendor
    chargePointModel
    chargePointSerialNumber
    firmwareVersion
    tenantId
    locationId
    latestOcppMessageTimestamp
    updatedAt
    capabilities
  }

  Connectors(where: {tenantId: {_eq: $tenantId}}) {
    id
    stationId
    chargingStationId
    connectorId
    evseId
    status
    isOnline
    updatedAt
  }

  Transactions(where: {tenantId: {_eq: $tenantId}}, order_by: {updatedAt: desc}, limit: 500) {
    id
    stationId
    chargingStationId
    transactionId
    isActive
    active
    startedAt
    stoppedAt
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

Notes:
- The integration now merges station + connector + transaction rows.
- Include `capabilities` in the station query if your Hasura schema exposes it; this allows HA to distinguish explicit lack of charging-profile support from missing metadata.
- Stop button and stop service can use discovered `active/current/previous` transaction id automatically.
- Start command can auto-select EVSE from connector rows.
- For OCPP 2.0.1, `remoteStartId` is derived from station transactions as `max(transactionId) + 1` when numeric, then incremented after each start.
- If your table/column names differ, adjust the query in options; the merge logic accepts station references from `stationId`, `chargingStationId`, or `identifier`.
